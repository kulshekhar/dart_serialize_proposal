## Want to update the proposal?

If you're updating a link, spelling, or making a slight change to `README.md`
you can simply propose a change - perhaps [directly on github][on_github].

*However*, if you'd like to add or remove a section or a meaningful amount of
content - or if you want to add commentary (you agree/disagree), please
[open an issue][issue] instead.

[on_github]: https://github.com/matanlurey/dart_serialize_proposal/edit/master/README.md
[issue]: https://github.com/matanlurey/dart_serialize_proposal/issues/new
